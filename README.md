This is my first project - a Google homepage.

TO-DO list:
1. Need to change positioning of the header and the footer. To spread out list items in such an uneven fashion, I used an element with wide margins in the footer and a really wide element in the header. Instead, I should try either grid or relative/absolute positioning (I lean toward the latter now).
2. Move #main elements a bit lower.
3. Make sure the whole page is responsive.
